      "Everyone here seems focused on advanced modelling and CS skills. If you want a high paying job, IMO just focus on SQL and business metrics\n",
      "I’ve been browsing this sub for over 5 years. Back when I started, I had a business undergrad degree and wanted to break into the world of advanced ML/AI. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I’ve found since getting into big tech as a # Data Scientist (if you listen to music odds are you use my company’s product) is that 99.99% of the skills involved are: \n",

      "My current TC is 300k (205k base) and I have yet to need anything fancier than a bar graph or a line chart. Yes there’s teams internally that use much more advanced math/causal inference, but for the majority of folks browsing here and looking for a career path, you’re over complicating things. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder why so many online look down at pseudo data analyst roles when they can have just as big of an impact as your cutting edge ML folks internally by convincing the CEO to cut/launch a product, and the pay is more than enough to live off of.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m on the interview panel for senior/staff DS and frequently get PHDs from top schools who don’t pass the bar because they can’t answer basic business case questions and can’t write basic SQL. They want to apply ML to the answer of every question when it’s not necessary.\n",
      "Having trouble finding a job. Ex-FAANG.\n",
      "I am an ex-FAANG data scientist. I didn't get laid off, but I went back to school to get an MBA during the last 2 years and am graduating in May during a supposed \"recession\". Tons of recent FAANG layoffs and hiring freezes have made me gun shy to apply to FAANG again. However, it appears that companies all over the world are actually having hiring freezes and layoffs, not just FAANG and Big Tech. I've been sending out resume's nonstop and I am starting to feel like I am wasting my time. I don't even get rejection emails. Just completely ghosted. No responses from 300+ applications sent in the past month or two. Literally ZERO interviews or phone screens by HR. Literally ZERO emails back asking about my availability. It's like a ghost town. I have a degree in CS from a top 50 university, an MS in Data Science from a top 30 school, and a soon to be MBA from an Ivy League school. I am trying to break into upper management in the Data Analytics domain. I am in a weird place because I feel like I can command FAANG level salaries, but FAANG isn't hiring anymore. Also, I feel like other companies see that I have FAANG and Ivy League MBA on my resume and think I want too much money and will go back to FAANG once the economy improves and hiring picks up again. I am basically screwed.\n",

AI stuff is all over like everyone knows already and people wonder what the heck is gonna happen with work in general across many white collar sectors. I genuinely don't know how this will play out but I don't think it's unwarranted to feel even Data Science will be hit and is not immune to it. I see many developers and many with considerable experience and expertise still concerned. I think people overly hairsplit and get into polarized arguments while missing this central point. AI will never be consciousness itself but that doesn't matter because it can still wipe out our jobs and do it them better and faster. This may not be too far off in the future. What you guys feel makes you different and not as concerned as other tech workers about being impacted by AI?\n",

I joined a few weeks ago and have been put in charge of coming up with a data catalog, but right now, all their data is either on spreadsheets or just on our CRM. We have a solid budget, but I'd love some advice on what can work quickly, as I'd like to start actually taking advantage of the data and get ahead of the problem.

      "I suspect for much of Apple’s life, the vast majority of Apple employees owned a piece of the company. I don’t know if Apple Store employees do - they may not - but Apple stores are a comparatively recent addition and I bet the engineering staff through the 90s were employee-owners as that’s the norm in Silicon Valley. At some point Apple made a decision to contract out manufacturing, so the people actually building Apple computers and phones are mostly not Apple employees and not owners. And it was certainly a significant decision to bring on venture capital investors (and later public shareholders) who were not employees of the company (though I think history would show pretty clearly that if they hadn’t done that we wouldn’t have Apple today). \n",
      "\n",
      "But I do think it’s worth noting that all of these *decisions* were, at Apple, mostly made by the early employees / founders, not by third party shareholders. That’s idiosyncratic to tech, an industry dominated by strong founders, but it’s true at Apple, at Google, at Facebook, at Amazon, etc - the decision makers are the founding employees. In fact at many of these companies the founders have put in place systems such that “capitalist” public owners explicitly DON’T have control of the business, only the founders do, long after the founder ownership levels have decreased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Goldman Sachs was a “partnership” for most of its history - ENTIRELY owned by a subset of its employee population. This is true for every major large corporate law firm today. Just because these businesses are “employee owned” clearly doesn’t mean they’re run “for the benefit of the people” - they’re run by rich early employees who want to get richer (and maybe have other motivations, like building great products, or personal celebrity, or whatever). \n",
      "\n",
      "I am a huge fan of “employee equity ownership” - most startups are built on the back of this idea - though most employees in turn eventually want to be able to sell their shares to other people (so they can buy houses and cars, or make charitable contributions or whatever). But I’m not sure employee ownership is a radical departure from ‘capitalism’ as you describe it - the ends ultimately look pretty similar to companies that are not employee owned.\n",
