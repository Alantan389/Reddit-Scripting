I joined a few weeks ago and have been put in charge of coming up with a data catalog, but right now, all their data is either on spreadsheets or just on our CRM. We have a solid budget, but I'd love some advice on what can work quickly, as I'd like to start actually taking advantage of the data and get ahead of the problem. What are the most useful products out there?\n",

      "I have been employed in research for the past few years and been doing data science actively in medical domain. Most of my previous working experience was collected at the university doing  research, whereas I managed to squeeze one year of industry Full Stack development in my CV, shortly before I began with my master's thesis. I have a master's degree in CS majoring DS. Ever since I finished my degree I kept doing data science in the research field.\n",

      "I'm thinking about switching back to industry, for a couple of reasons. Not sure if it's gonna be Full Stack development or DS. So, I'm wondering, what do you guys do in your daily industry DS jobs and how would you describe your job? Is it more of a static job, doing some analytics rather than true data science stuff? Is you job dynamic in terms of topics you are touching and problem solving? Do you have daily meetings discussing stuff with your team (is there a need for dailys in your job at all)?\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally find my job in research highly interesting, because of it's dynamic nature, but also pretty overwhelming, thinking I would have to keep this pace for the next 25-30 years. The Full Stack development I did for the one company was rather dynamic to a certain extent (where you'd be working with different technologies/frameworks depending on the project), but you also had tasks where you actually relax your mind for a bit and do some stuff mechanically (mostly frontend). The struggle at my current job is, that there are few to none of those mind-relaxing tasks. Tasks are mainly or algorithmic nature and require full focus on small details while being developed. I would considering mind-relaxing evaluating my plots (couple of minutes) which is short in comparison to the code development and thinking (good amount of day).\n",

I find it incredibly unlikely that I'll stand out, and it makes me wonder if it's even worth submitting an ad-hoc resume highlighting my relevant expertise if I'm not going to hear back. \n",

      "\n",
      "As data scientists, we know that our work involves more than just language processing. We work with complex data sets, statistical models, and machine learning algorithms, and it takes years of experience and expertise to master these skills. However, with the rapid advancements in AI technology, it's understandable that people are worried about their job security.\n",

      "\n",
      "Personally, I believe that GPT-4 will be a valuable tool for data scientists to use in their work, but it cannot replace the skills and creativity of human experts. We need to continue to improve our skills and adapt to new technologies as they emerge. By staying up-to-date with the latest developments in AI and data science, we can ensure that we remain relevant and valuable in the job market.\n",
